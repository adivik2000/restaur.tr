# Restaur.tr

This is a rails weekend project that aims to create a "tumbler for
restaurants." We were inspired by a "restaurant websites are crappy"
blog post and want to help restaurant owners help that. So, we aim to
create a curated space for restaurants to create a low cost website.

A project by David Pick (@davidpick) and Derek Hammer (@hammerdr).
